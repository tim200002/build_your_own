Build your own 3D renderer - Javascript
=======================================

This repository contains an implementation of the projects outlined in [the Build your own 3D renderer workshop](https://avik-das.github.io/build-your-own-raytracer/). The implementation is in Javascript, using 2D canvas.

Quick Start
-----------

```sh
git clone https://github.com/avik-das/build-your-own-raytracer-js.git
cd build-your-own-raytracer-js

# Open in a supported browser
chrome index.html
```

Browser support
---------------

The implementation uses a number of ES2016 features, including `let`, arrow functions, and classes, all without any transpilation. A recent enough browser is needed to support these features.

Tagged milestones
-----------------

Each commit of the project implements one of the projects in the workshop. If you wish to implement one of the projects yourself, you can check out the `before-project-N` tag, where `N` is the project number. This will put you in a state just prior to the implementation of that project, with all previous projects implemented:

```sh
# Prepare to implement Project 4
git checkout before-project-4
```
